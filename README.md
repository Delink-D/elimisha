#Elimisha Management System

This is an online school management styem that allows a streamlined 
process of managing school processes like registration of students, managenment of funds and delivery of content.

 Also we have created a alernative loan distribution system that allows the 
 student to have more control in payment of the fees.

 This is  through making small regular payments (weekly basis) before the course starts and take loans on the balances rather than the whole fees amount
